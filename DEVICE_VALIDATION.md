# Device validation

## User-confirmed 0.6.1~dev.bridgefix1

Target: iPhone12,5, iOS26.0.1 build23A355. Dopamine rootless is user-reported; ElleKit1.2 and OS/device identifiers were shown in earlier device screenshots. The exact Dopamine version is not recorded.

Evidence supplied by the user:

- `command -v launchctl` returns `/var/jb/usr/bin/launchctl`.
- Installing0.6.1~dev.bridgefix1 over0.6.0~dev.bridge1 completed package configuration without the earlier missing-launchctl error.
- After respring, pressing the Safari launch action inside PPO actually opened Safari. This is visual user confirmation, beyond the helper's accepted-request return value.

The panel-to-service launch path is therefore confirmed for this operation on this device. The earlier0.5.10/0.5.11 SpringBoard posix_spawn EPERM no longer prevents this launch path. Its precise enforcement cause remains unproven; the architecture avoids that process creation rather than changing sandbox or injection settings.

Not established by this test: launching other apps, repeated/restart/lock/orientation stress, emergency-disable behavior on the phone, full Dopamine/ElleKit compatibility, or application content hosted in floating windows. Floating application hosting remains unimplemented. main and stable/verified-app-picker remain unchanged; this single operation does not promote the development branch to a fully validated release.
